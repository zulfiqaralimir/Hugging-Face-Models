The error message you received indicates that the model `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B` is too large to be loaded automatically via the **Hugging Face Inference API**. The model exceeds the 10GB limit for automatic loading, and Hugging Face suggests using either **Spaces or Inference Endpoints** to deploy and use such large models.

### What You Can Do:

#### 1. **Use Hugging Face Spaces**:

- **Hugging Face Spaces** is a platform that allows you to deploy machine learning models and apps, including large models like `Meta-Llama-3-8B`.
- You can create a Space and deploy the model there, which allows you to interact with it via a **custom interface or API**.

- **Steps**:
  1.  Go to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces).
  2.  Create a new Space and select the appropriate framework (e.g., Gradio, Streamlit).
  3.  Deploy your model in the Space and use the provided API to interact with it.

#### 2. **Use Hugging Face Inference Endpoints**:

- **Inference Endpoints** are a more scalable and powerful option for deploying large models. They allow you to **set up a dedicated endpoint** that can handle the resource requirements of large models.
- **Steps**:
  1.  Go to [Hugging Face Inference Endpoints](https://huggingface.co/inference-endpoints).
  2.  Set up an endpoint for your model.
  3.  Once the endpoint is live, you'll receive a URL that you can use in your API requests, similar to how you were trying to use the Inference API.

#### 3. **Use a Smaller Model**:

- If your use case allows, consider using a smaller model that can be loaded automatically. For instance, using models like `gpt2` or other variants that are within the 10GB limit.
- You can simply replace the model in your API URL with a smaller one.

### Example with a Smaller Model:

```python
API_URL = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/gpt2"  # or another smaller model
```

### Summary:

- **Use Hugging Face Spaces** if you want to deploy the large model with a custom interface.
- **Use Hugging Face Inference Endpoints** for scalable deployment of large models.
- **Consider using a smaller model** that fits within the 10GB limit if it's suitable for your needs.

By following these steps, you'll be able to either deploy the large model in a way that fits your needs or switch to a smaller model that works with the standard Inference API.
